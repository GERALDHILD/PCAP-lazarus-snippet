# PCAP-lazarus-snippet
A little software to learn how to use NPCAP dll with "lazarus"
This little software demontrate the use of NPCAP library with "lazarus".
The software list every ethernet interface, open the link and read raw ethernet frame on the opened interface.
It's only made to understand how to use pcap.pp.
I compile it with a fork of lazarus : Codetyphon 7.5
The PCAP.pp file is a part of codetyphon
the dll are part of NPCAP library.

COMPILE : 
- Install NPCAP library first
- Open ctpr file with CodeTyphon
- Compile it

NOTES :
For the moment, the software is made to work under Windows but in the near future, it will work under Linux.
